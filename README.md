# Coding-Projects

Hello, my name is Colton and I am an aspiring programmer that is interested in exploring all avenues of development.
I have successfully completed Harvard's CS50P Python Programming course with a verified certificate.
Over the past year I have been practicing and improving my Python knowledge as well as my general coding knowledge. 

I am currently doing research into source control and how to efficiently use it to my advantage.
Another ongoing project is my Discord bot that I intend on being a long-term project that will be improved as my skills and my understanding of the discord.py libraries do.
