#### CSV Cleaner

This project was designed to take a .csv file and organize the values into new dictionary objects that can be referenced easier. It will look at the information in the "old" file and then create a "new" organized .csv file.

### modify_file

Will read each row in the "old" file and then create a dictionary item for the first, last, and house. It will then write this information into a new file.
